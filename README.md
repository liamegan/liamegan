# G'day, I'm Liam.

I'm a creative developer at heart. I've been working in the marketing and advertising industry since 1999, cut my teeth on Flash (AS3 forever) and eventually moved into the world of javascript and webgl. I have a solid background in maths and talk often about how to use it to create novel things. I've published and contributed  to opensource libraries for technologies, ideas and techniques that I love.

## Where I am
Currently, I work for We The Collective as Director of Technology.
